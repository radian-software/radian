  "Establish functions and keybindings to open a dotfile.

The FILENAME should be a path relative to the user's home
directory. Two interactive functions are created: one to find the
file in the current window, and one to find it in another window.

If KEYBINDING is non-nil, the first function is bound to that key
sequence after it is prefixed by `radian-find-dotfile-prefix'. If
OTHER-WINDOW-KEYBINDING is nil, the second function is bound to
the same key sequence, but prefixed instead by
`radian-find-dotfile-other-window-prefix' (provided that the two
prefixes are different). If a key sequence (a string) is provided
for OTHER-WINDOW-KEYBINDING, that key sequence is used
instead (provided that the new key sequence is distinct from the
first one). If OTHER-WINDOW-KEYBINDING is neither nil nor a
string, no keybinding is established.

This is best demonstrated by example. Suppose FILENAME is
\".emacs.d/init.el\", KEYBINDING is \"e i\", and
`radian-find-dotfile-prefix' is at its default value of \"M-P
e\", and `radian-find-dotfile-other-window-prefix' is at its
default value of \"M-P o\". Then `radian-register-dotfile' will
create the interactive functions `radian-find-init-el' and
`radian-find-init-el-other-window', and it will bind them to the
key sequences \"M-P e e i\" and \"M-P o e i\" respectively."
