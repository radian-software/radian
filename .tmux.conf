### Unbreak things ###

# Prevent tmux from messing up keybindings and colors.
# This is witchcraft, I have no explanation for the following commands.
set -g xterm-keys on

# Prevent tmux from waiting half a second before processing the ESC key, see:

### Keybindings ###

# Use ` instead of C-b as prefix key, see:
# http://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-guide-to-customizing-your-tmux-conf/
unbind C-b
set -g prefix `
bind ` send-prefix

# Turn off repeatability for moving between panes. Otherwise, if you split
# horizontally and switch panes, you will have to wait for the 'repeat period'
# to expire before you can use <Up> and <Down> to page through shell history.
#
# Doing it this way instead of using 'set-option -g repeat-time 0' makes it
# so that Control+Arrows and Meta+Arrows (for resizing panes) are still
# repeatable.

### Status bar ###

# The following code is adapted from:
# https://coderwall.com/p/trgyrq/make-your-tmux-status-bar-responsive
# It provides the same appearance as https://github.com/powerline/powerline,
# but sidesteps the environment/configuration hell which that project
# introduces.

# Format to display on the left-hand side of the status bar.
# Note that the conditional #{?cond,true,false} operator does not do any
# fancy parsing, so you can't have literal commas in the conditions --
# this will cause the conditions to be split up. So we have to use multiple
# style #[attr=value] directives.
set -g status-left '#{?client_prefix,#[fg=colour254]#[bg=colour31],#[fg=colour16]#[bg=colour254]#[bold]} #{=80:session_name} #{?client_prefix,#[fg=colour31],#[fg=colour254]}#[bg=colour234,nobold] '

# Maximum length of the format displayed on the left-hand side.
# Since the maximum length of the session name is limited in the above
# format string, this number is unimportant -- it just needs to be a
# bit larger than what is allocated for the session name, to allow for
# the surrounding characters.
set -g status-left-length 90

# Format to display on the right-hand side of the status bar.
set -g status-right ''

# Format to display for the current window.
set -g window-status-current-format "#[fg=colour234,bg=colour31]#[fg=colour117,bg=colour31] #{window_index}#{window_flags}  #[fg=colour231,bold]#{window_name} #[fg=colour31,bg=colour234,nobold]   "

# Format to display for other windows.
set -g window-status-format "#[fg=colour244,bg=colour234]#{window_index}#{window_flags} #[fg=colour240] #[fg=colour249]#{window_name}     "

# Background color for parts of the status bar not specified by the above
# formats. For instance, the empty space to the right, and the single
# spaces between instances of window-status-format.
set -g status-bg colour234

# Inhibit the default styling for windows with unseen activity, which
# looks blatantly incorrect with the "powerline" theme we are trying to
# emulate.

# Update the status bar every second, instead of the default 15(!)
# seconds. It doesn't look like it's possible to update more than

# Don't automatically rename windows if they have been explicity
# renamed by the user.

# Make the borders of the current pane the same color as the borders
# of other panes. This is because the borders of the marked pane are
# *inverted*, and while different foreground colors in different parts
# of the frame are not too objectionable, different background colors
# look very bad.
