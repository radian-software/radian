defined at the time the top-level form is evaluated, but will be
defined by time the sub-form's code is evaluated. This macro
handles its arguments in some way other than evaluating them
directly. And finally, one of the arguments of this macro could
be interpreted itself as a macro invocation, and expanding the

  "Automatically create and delete parent directories of new files.
This advice automatically creates the parent directory (or directories) of
the file being visited, if necessary. It also sets a buffer-local
variable so that the user will be prompted to delete the newly
created directories if they kill the buffer without saving it.

sequence after it is prefixed by \"\\[radian-keymap] e\", and the
second function is bound to the same key sequence, but prefixed
instead by \"\\[radian-keymap] o\".

This is best demonstrated by example. Suppose FILENAME is

`radian-register-dotfile' will create the interactive functions
`radian-find-init-el' and `radian-find-init-el-other-window', and

i\" and \"\\[radian-keymap] o e i\" respectively.

If PRETTY-FILENAME, a string, is non-nil, then it will be used in

  "Replacement for `do-auto-fill' that respects `normal-auto-fill-function'.
The reason we need this is that in order to enable auto-fill
globally, we are supposed to set the default value of variable
`auto-fill-function'. However, some major modes set
`normal-auto-fill-function' (itself normally set to
`do-auto-fill', which is what we generally set the default value
of variable `auto-fill-function' to), expecting `auto-fill-mode'
to be enabled afterwards (which copies the value of
`normal-auto-fill-function' into variable `auto-fill-function').
However, since we enable auto-fill globally by means of setting
variable `auto-fill-function' directly, this setting gets lost.
The workaround is to set variable `auto-fill-function' globally
to a function which looks up the value of
`normal-auto-fill-function' \(generally just `do-auto-fill') and
calls that. This is a slight inversion of the usual flow of
control and might make you slightly uncomfortable, but we'll just
have to live with it :3"
