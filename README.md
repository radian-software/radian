# Radian

Dotfiles that marry elegance and practicality. I write my dotfiles
with an eye to:

* extensive documentation and commentary within and outside of the
  code
* harnessing the full power of software while staying true to its
  original spirit (and keybindings!)
* fully automatic installation and management, but with full support
  for a partially or fully manual configuration
* first-class support for local customization without the need for
  forking

## Software configured, features

* [Emacs]
    * Next-generation package manager, [straight.el]
    * Future-proof customizations using [el-patch]
    * Extensive use of deferred installation: no need to
      install [`markdown-mode`][markdown-mode] until you open a
      Markdown file
    * Sorting by frecency and usage on all commands using [Historian]
    * Informative but minimal mode-line showing file modification
      status, buffer name, point position, current project, Git
      branch, and active modes
    * Extremely clean mode lighters
    * Delightful color scheme that works in the terminal
    * Clipboard, mouse, and PATH integration with macOS
    * Automatic creation and interactive removal of parent directories
      when finding files
    * Extensible system for defining mnemonic key sequences to jump to
      dotfiles
    * Emacsclient as a Git commit message editor
    * Lots of packages for pushing around windows and buffers in
      interesting ways
    * Configured packages: [aggressive-indent-mode], [Autorevert],
      [Company], [company-statistics], [Counsel],
      [delete-selection-mode], [EasyPG], [ElDoc], [Electric-Pair],
      [Flx], [Flycheck], [Historian], [Ivy], [Magit], [no-littering],
      [Org], [Paredit], [Projectile], [Smex], [Swiper], [undo-tree],
      [use-package], [visual-regexp], [YASnippet] (... and dozens
      more, but these are the biggest ones)
    * Supported languages: C/C++, [Clojure], JavaScript, [LaTeX],
      [Markdown], [Python], [Racket], [Ruby], [Rust], [TypeScript]
      (... and dozens more, but these are the biggest ones with the
      most sophisticated support)
* [Zsh]
    * Next-generation package manager, [zplug]
    * No-nonsense prompt showing working directory and Git status,
      colored by exit code
    * Substring completion everywhere
    * Aliases for [Exa], a modern replacement for `ls`
    * GUI-like copy/paste functions on the command line
    * Extensive library of clean and consistent [Git] aliases
    * Colored man pages
* [Tmux]
    * Keybindings for inserting new windows and shifting them left and
      right
    * No-nonsense but stylish status bar Ã  la [powerline] but without
      the dependencies
    * Spectacular hack to leverage [reattach-to-user-namespace] on
      macOS with minimal side effects
* [Git]
    * Create a repository and a root commit all at once
    * Rename stashes
    * Reword a commit while preserving the index
    * Alias and unalias without messing with `git config`
    * More helpful output from `git status`, merge conflicts,
      submodules, and more
* [Leiningen]
    * Modular profile system allowing maximal performance through
      selecting exactly the features you want
    * Inject useful utility functions using [Vinyasa]
    * Pull JARs from Maven and hotload them into your REPL with
      [Alembic]
    * Refresh a dirty REPL a restart, using [tools.namespace]
    * Colorization and pretty-printing of output and stack traces in
      the REPL

## Release 1.0

Check out [the issue tracker][1.0] to see what I have planned for the
first stable release of Radian. The biggest tasks still remaining are:

* Creating a stable release of my Emacs package manager,
  [straight.el], upon which Radian depends.
* Creating a stable release of my generalized dotfile, installation,
  and system manager, [Dotman], which will provide for a fully
  automated setup experience.
* Writing an exhaustive user manual covering all commonly used
  features of the software Radian configures.
